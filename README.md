In task 1 firstly i take the input from user and then in if statement i give the condition if (a%2==0) then it is an even number because % gives the remainder if the remainder is zero so it is completely divisible by 2 i.e. even number otherwise odd number.
In task 2 firstly i declare sum = 0 then apply for loop using range from 1 to 51 because in range 51 is not included so the loop will continue from 1 to 50 , inside for loop I applied sum of each iteration till last range then outside for loop printing it.
